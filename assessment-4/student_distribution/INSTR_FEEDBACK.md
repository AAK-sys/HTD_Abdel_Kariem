### STATUS: REQUIRES CORRECTIONS

### INSTR FEEDBACK (SC):  
- I had to replace the `ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server with `ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server` to make it all work.
- You missed two functions in the `data_quality.py` file: `check_duplicates` and `quality_report`. Should be a minor fix.
- Well done. Sorry I took so long
